# CHIP-ATE

A small CHIP-8 interpreter I've been working on after being inspired by [isakbjugn](https://github.com/isakbjugn)'s [talk](https://vimeo.com/1115577320]).

Tested using [Timendus' amazing test suite](https://github.com/Timendus/chip8-test-suite)

Currently passes all relevant tests for the original CHIP-8 except sound, display wait, and for some reason I can't figure out, clipping.
